    <h1>Where do I start?</h1>
    <p>We'll go straight to the nitty gritty here: there are lots of places to start learning programming but it all depends on what you want to do. For example, constructing and styling websites is a excellent entry point as it is possible to create some great looking and practical webpages in a relatively short amount of time. On the other hand, creating software, such as games, requires somewhat more in depth knowledge of a programming language and may take longer before practical results can be seen. In all cases, it takes dedication and practice to become truly good but we all have to start somewhere!</p>

        Making websites is a very rewarding experience where you can see all the fruits of your labour right there in your browser at any time. The start, All webpages have a basic backbone of 3 coding languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript. This includes the simplest blog layout to massive, shiny corporate websites to your favourite ecommerce site.
        But don't worry if 3 languages sounds like a lot, there are plenty of free resources online and "in real life" which can help you get started. Click on the buttons below to find out more about each language or on "I want to start now!" to skip to the resources that will help you learn.

        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
        <p>This means that it provides the structure and layout of the website which is done so using tags. Without an html structure, there is no website! The newest iteration of HTML is HTML5 which has some small differences from HTML4 but also some really cool new features that you can mess around with. It's recommended to learn the newest version as older versions are gradually phased out and may be at risk of security issues. That said, HTML5 and browsers in general are all backwards compatible so an old website written in HTML2 would still display the same as it did when it was first written.</p>

        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets</p>
        <p>You always need to first have an HTML structure down for your webpage but it will still look very plain. That's where CSS comes in. CSS determines all the styling on the page including the colours, shapes, fonts and sizes of elements. It does so by referencing an element that was established in the HTML and changing an attribute associated with it. The CSS of a page may be written in the same document as the HTML but common practice is to write it in a separate file and to link it to the main HTML document. In this way, you can completely change the look of a website despite it having the same HTML structure.

        <p>Javascript stands for... well, just Javascript</p>
        <p>Lets go with an analogy here. If HTML is the tabletop and legs of a table, then CSS is the paint or carvings on the table to make it look nice. Javascript would then be adding drawers and additional functionality to the table that make your experience more enjoyable. </p>
        <p>That's right, Javascript provides interactivity to a website such as pop-up boxes, animations and much much more. But Javascript is also a very broad language and there are 'libraries' which people have developed to make doing some things much easier and one of most common of these is jQuery which most of our recommended resources choose to teach.

        <h3>Python is named after Monty Python.</h3>
        <p>Of the three languages mentioned in this section, Python is the youngest and is still gaining popularity. It's often recommended for beginners due to being easy to read and learn and there's a plethora of resources and documentation in the form of online material as well as books to help you get started. A technical caveat of Python compared to other languages is that it runs slower due to being hugely flexible.</p>

        <h3>Java is not related to Javascript!</h3>
        <p>Java is a staple in most Computer Science degrees as it was designed to be more beginner friendly than C++ by handling more complex functions for you, such as memory management. It is also hugely popular within industry, thus has a lot of resources and documentation available too AND it would be a valuable skill to have for career options. One downside to Java is though, is that it is very wordy and requires a lot of coding to reach a usable application.

        <p>C++ is the oldest of the languages mentioned here and is deemed as the most difficult to learn. However but is arguably the most powerful. If you're looking to build complex programs, systems or games, then C++ is the way to go, just be prepared to put in the long hours to truly master this language.

    <h1>Resources to use</h1>
    <p>So now that you know a little bit about the languages to learn, you're raring to go. But just a moment, there are many resources that teach the same or similar topics in different styles, some are free, some require a one-off payment and some are subscription services. We recommend trying out some free trials before settling for a particular course to see if the teaching style suits you.</p>
