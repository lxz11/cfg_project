    <h1>Where do I start?</h1>
    <p>We'll go straight to the nitty gritty here: there are lots of places to start learning programming but it all depends on what you want to do. For example, constructing and styling websites is a excellent entry point as it is possible to create some great looking and practical webpages in a relatively short amount of time. On the other hand, creating software, such as games, requires somewhat more in depth knowledge of a programming language and may take longer before practical results can be seen. In all cases, it takes dedication and practice to become truly good but we all have to start somewhere!</p>
    <p>Click the links below to skip to the relevant section or scroll down to read a little more about each area. We couldn't possibly cover all the things you can do with programming though so make sure to search around and read up on your chosen area.</p>

        Making websites is a very rewarding experience where you can see all the fruits of your labour right there in your browser at any time. The start, All webpages have a basic backbone of 3 coding languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript. This includes the simplest blog layout to massive, shiny corporate websites to your favourite ecommerce site.
        But don't worry if 3 languages sounds like a lot, there are plenty of free resources online and "in real life" which can help you get started. Click on the buttons below to find out more about each language or on "I want to start now!" to skip to the resources that will help you learn.

        <p>You always need to first have an HTML structure down for your webpage but it will still look very plain. That's where CSS comes in. CSS determines all the styling on the page including the colours, shapes, fonts and sizes of elements. It does so by referencing an element that was established in the HTML and changing an attribute associated with it. The CSS of a page may be written in the same document as the HTML but common practice is to write it in a separate file and to link it to the main HTML document. In this way, you can completely change the look of a website despite it having the same HTML structure.
